#This service is written in NodeJS, Hence need to install NodeJS in the system.
#
#  # yum install nodejs make gcc-c++ -y
#Let's now set up the User application.
#
#As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.
#
#So to run the User service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. Hence we will use roboshop as the username to run the service.
#
#  # useradd roboshop
#So let's switch to the roboshop user and run the following commands.
#
#$ curl -s -L -o /tmp/user.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/user/archive/main.zip"
#$ cd /home/roboshop
#$ unzip /tmp/user.zip
#$ mv user-main user
#$ cd /home/roboshop/user
#$ npm install
#Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.
#
## mv /home/roboshop/user/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/user.service
## systemctl daemon-reload
## systemctl start user
## systemctl enable user
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  (as all the steps of user and catalogue are common and we should keep the code dry that
# means not repeatable, so for that in the ‘common’ directory create a file ‘nodejs.yml’ and paste the
# catalogue main.yml code and replace all catalogue with {{COMPONENT}}.


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# yum install nodejs make gcc-c++ -y
# here we have to install 3 packages so first we need to check whether yum module supports installing all
# packages at once or do we have to write it 3 times speparately for each package.
# (google: yum module ansible)

# So let's switch to the roboshop user and run the following commands.
# but these steps should be run as a normal user but u r performing as a root user so
# u need to think about the fixing of permissions , so copy module has a permission to fix
# (google: copy module ansible) here we have option of declaring as owner, but in ansible
# there is an option 'become_user: roboshop' we can use this also. 'become' is there to execute
# as a root user, 'become_user' is there to execute that particular task as another user.

#    # mv /home/roboshop/catalogue/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service
